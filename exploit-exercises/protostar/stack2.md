### Solution


This problem is similar to the previous one. Only this time we read input from
the environmental variable, not from the stdin. Reading env variable introduces
new `variable` variable to the main function, but it doesn't change the
arrangement of variables in our program.

`buffer` is at 0x18 offset from the `$esp`.
`variable` is at 0x5c offset from the `$esp`.
`modified` is at 0x58 offset from the `$esp`.

So if we want to overwrite the the modified variable we have to write 0x58 -
0x18 = 64 bytes + desired value.

	GREENIE=$(python -c "print('a' * 64 + '\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d')") ./stack2
